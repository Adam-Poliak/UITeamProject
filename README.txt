The prescription filler app:

it automatically calls ur pharamacy to refill meds.
saves you having to call the doctor & pharmacy...could make oodles of loot because people are stupid & lazy, i dunno.
but i'd be down to do whatever anyone wants to do if that doesn't sound like a worthwhile endeavor
 it's usually a hassle...this would just make it a lot easier for everyone involved. but you're right that something is kinda already in place
so the app could keep track for them
keep track of all the medication, and let a person decide when & where to pick it up
